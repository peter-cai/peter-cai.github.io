# Why Us Study on the Short-term Traffic Forecasting
* Heavy travel demand and traffic congestion 
* Real-time data collecting technology

# How to operate the K-Nearest Neighbor Model
* Building a historical database.
* Setting an appropriate state space.
* Selecting k-nearest neighbors.
* Integrating the generations of neighbors.

# What are the Improved Methods
* Related Road Segments Concerned
* Spatiotemporal State Matrix 
* Gaussian Weighted Distribution

# What are the Conclutions from this Study
* Improved methods with KNN model proved effective for short-term traffic forecasting.
* Further application:  To supplement real-time data when speed detectors failed in some  segments.
