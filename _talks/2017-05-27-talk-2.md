# BACKGROUND
* System Identification Problems
  * Tendency of stock in finance
  * Rainfall probability in meteorology
  * Congestion in transportation
* Tough Issues
  * Non-linear suquence
  * Time-varying occasion

# RBF NEURAL NETWORK
* Kernel mapping: Radial basis function
* Sparse modeling:Orthogonal least square (OLS) & Forward method 
* Parameter determination: Generalized inverse

# MULTI-KERNEL MODEL

* Multi-Kernel RBF Model Using State Matching （SMMK-RBF）Algorithm：
  * Step 1: off-line process
    * Generate several submodels 
    * Get parsimonious  models by OLS 
    * Initialize weights by historical data
  * Step 2: on-line process
    * State matching method
    * Adjust weights
    * Integrate results
# SIMULATION
* Mackey-Glass Time Series
* Real Time Series

# DISCUSSION
* Robustness
  Adjusting the weights of all kernels with a forgetting factor instead of switching to the best kernel at each time.
* Weakness
  Focusing on the existed dynamic properties of systems while it cannot cover the unforeseeable properties.
* Further Research
  To Analyze the fitness of different kernel functions in particular applications and establish the hybrid kernel models.
