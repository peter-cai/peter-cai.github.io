**Abstract**: Most k-nearest neighbor models only focus on single step short-term traffic forecasting andcan't perform well when extended to multi-stepforecast. To enhance accuracy, this paper presents an improved k-nearest neighbor model considering thespatiotemporal correlation. The proposed model defines the current conditionsbythetwo-dimensionalspatiotemporalstate matrices, instead of the one-dimensional state vectorof thetime series. Moreover, this paperdeterminesthe weights by Gaussian functionto adjust the matching distance andmanage the data of the nearest neighbors. The original speed data used in this paper arenormalized in order to apply the proposed model to different types of road segments. The case showsthe improved model performs more desirablethan the original k-nearest neighbormodels and demonstrates more appropriate for multi-step forecast ofthe roadspeed.
